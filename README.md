# planet-order-ps
Open a downloaded Planet order in Photoshop. Each scene in the order will be
correctly placed relatively to each other, each in a separate layer.

## Installation
To install the script copy the `Load Planet Order.jsx` file in your Photoshop
scripts directory.
  * Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop [version]\Presets\Scripts
  * Mac OS X: Applications/Photoshop [version]/Presets/Scripts

## Usage
When the script is installed it will provide a menu item under `file > scripts`
Selecting the menu item will prompt you to select a directory containing an
unzipped Planet order. (Orders can be generated using the
[Scenes Explorer](https://www.planet.com/scenes))
If your order contains `analytic` scenes, you may (optionally) provide
a curves file in Photoshop `.acv` format which will be applied to all
analytic scenes in the order.
Once the script is done, it will produce a 16bit file as large as the
bounding box of all scenes contained in the order. Each scene will be
placed in its appropriate position within the bounding box.
